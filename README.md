# Geometry
C++ Classes for geometry solving

## Running

To run the program you should run the command

Linux / Mac OS:
```
g++ --std=c++20 -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined *.cpp
```

Windows:
```
g++ --std=c++20 *.cpp
```

## Usage

You should write your solutions in main.cpp (See Instruments for better understanding)

## Instruments

This set of files provide you with such structures as `Point`, `Vector` and `Plane`. Each of them could be printed on screen via `cout`.

Methods section will be added in future, for better understanding check `geometry.hpp` file.
